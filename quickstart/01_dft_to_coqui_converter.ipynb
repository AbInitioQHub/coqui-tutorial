    "As shown in the highlighted portion of the CoQuí workflow, this notebook introduces the **entry point of a CoQuí calculation**: how to prepare the inputs for many-body simulations in CoQuí.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To set up a many-body calculation in CoQuí, two kinds of information are essential:\n",
    "1. **Crystal metadata**, such as the k-point mesh and unit cell information.\n",
    "2. **Single-particle Bloch orbitals** that provide the basis for representing the interacting problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The single-particle orbitals in (1) are most commonly obtained from a mean-field calculation such as density functional theory (DFT), Hartree–Fock (HF), or another single-particle method. These orbitals provide both a **physically motivated basis** for the material of interest and, in many-body perturbation theory, a **reference state** for perturbative expansions. \n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 Alternatively, one may also start from a **pre-optimized localized basis** (e.g. Gaussian-type orbitals) or other basis sets tailored to the problem at hand. CoQuí is flexible in this regard: what matters is that the chosen orbitals and crystal metadata are expressed in the standardized format understood by CoQuí.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, a subset of these Bloch orbitals is further transformed into **maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWFs)** [[1](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.65.035109), [2](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.56.12847)]. MLWFs serve two crucial roles:\n",
    "- They give a **compact real-space representation** that allows **interpolation** of spectral properties to dense k-meshes.  \n",
    "- They define **physically motivated subspaces** needed for embedding methods such as DMFT or EDMFT.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, a practical obstacle is that each electronic-structure package (QE, VASP, PySCF, …) stores these quantities in its own format. CoQuí therefore provides **custom converters** that translate external outputs into a CoQuí-readable format. Currently, [Quantum ESPRESSO](https://www.quantum-espresso.org) (QE) and [PySCF](https://pyscf.org) are supported. In this tutorial, we focus on the QE interface.\n",
