    "# cRPA Screened Interactions with CoQuí\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous GW tutorial, we have learned how to perform a GW electronic-structure calculation in CoQuí using a compressed Coulomb Hamiltonian and how to post-process the results with maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWFs). Beyond post-processing, **MLWFs also play a central role in CoQuí’s embedding and downfolding functionality**, providing the **bridge** between a full *ab initio* calculation and a reduced low-energy description.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explore one such application: using the **constrained random phase approximation (cRPA)** to computes the *frequency-dependent effective Coulomb interactions* $U(\\omega)$ for the V $t_{2g}$ states in SrVO$_3$ (highlighted in red in Figure 1). By separating screening processes exclusively *within* the target subspace (V $t_{2g}$) from those *outside* it, cRPA delivers the *residual* screening needed to construct an effective low-energy Hamiltonian. This procedure is central to embedding approaches such as DMFT or EDMFT, where the Hubbard $U(\\omega)$ serves as a key input.  \n",

    "\n",
    "It is important to note that although the $U(\\omega)$ computed in cRPA is not identical to the interaction used in GW+EDMFT, both evaluations in CoQuí rely on the **same downfolding interface**. They accept the same inputs (mean-field object, MLWF projectors, Coulomb Hamiltonian) and produce the same outputs (a frequency-dependent local tensor $U_{ijkl}(\\tau)$). In the next tutorial, we will revisit the same function call in the GW+EDMFT setting, where only the definition of screening changes, yielding the local interaction consistent with the GW+EDMFT self-consistency loop. \n",

The simple cubic symmetry and the well-isolated $t_{2g}$ subspace make SrVO$_3$ a standard benchmark for the cRPA method and for constructing low-energy Hubbard-like models, with typical literature values [[1]](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.86.165105): \n",

    "## 🔧 Technical aside — Imaginary‑axis meshes & Fourier transforms\n",
    "\n",
    "Many CoQuí workflows require moving between the **imaginary-time domain (τ)** and the **Matsubara-frequency domain (iω$_n$)**. This is essential not only inside electronic-structure solvers, but also for analyzing and plotting correlation functions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To make this seamless, CoQuí provides the `IAFT` class (available in both Python and C++). It offers a unified interface to:  \n",
    "- Construct fermionic/bosonic meshes in τ and iω$_n$. \n",
    "- Perform Fourier transforms between τ and iω$_n$. \n",
    "- Ensure consistency with IR-basis conventions used elsewhere in CoQuí.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This class is particularly useful for post-processing correlation functions and in DMFT/EDMFT workflows when exchanging data with external libraries that may use different mesh definitions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use `IAFT` to Fourier transform the screened interaction from imaginary time, $W(\\tau)$, to Matsubara frequencies, $W(i\\Omega_n)$, in order to analyze its frequency dependence and extract the static limit.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example - `IAFT` class\n",
    "This example shows how to initialize an `IAFT` object and access some of its commonly used members and functions.  \n",

    "### 🖐️ Hands-on 2: Plotting the frequency dependence of the screened interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of `downfold_local_coulomb` gives the dynamically screened interaction on the **imaginary-time axis** $U_{abcd}(\\tau)$.  \n",
    "The goal of this hands-on is to Fourier transform $U(\\tau)$ to the bosonic Matsubara frequency axis $U(i\\Omega_{n})$ and visualize how screening evolves with frequency. \n",
    "\n",
    "🪜 **Your task:**\n",
    "1. Initialize an `IAFT` object with the same `beta`, `wmax`, and `prec` as in your cRPA calculation.  \n",

    "   Uloc_iw = IAFT.tau_to_w_phsym(Uloc_t, stats='b')\n",
    "```\n",
    "> ⚠️ **Note**: Because $U(\\tau)$ has particle–hole symmetry, only the first half of the τ mesh (from $0$ to $\\beta/2$) is stored in `Uloc_t`. The `IAFT` routines automatically account for this when using the functions with `_phsym` suffix.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Select representative matrix elements, such as the diagonal $U_{aaaa}$ and one inter-orbital $U_{abab}$.\n",
    "4. Plot **Re**[$U(i\\Omega_n)$] vs $\\Omega_n$.\n",
    "5. (Optional) Run the same workflow (downfold_local_coulomb) once with screening type equals to `\"rpa\"`. Compare the resulting $U(i\\Omega_n)$ curve against the `\"crpa\"` result, where only the residual screening outside the target subspace is kept.\n",

    "### 🖐️ Hands-on 4: Effect of the Energy Window in cRPA\n",
    "In cRPA, the definition of the low-energy subspace depends on the **Wannier energy window** used to build the MLWF projectors. Enlarging this window includes more bands in the Wannierization, typically producing **more localized MLWFs**, which in turn **tends to increase** both the bare $V$ and the dynamic screened interaction $U(\\tau)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "🪜 **Your task**\n",
    "1. Re-run the cRPA calculation with MLWFs generated using a **larger Wannier window** (a pre-generated archive is provided at `data/qe_inputs/svo/222/mlwf_dp/`).\n",
    "   > 🔎 **Clarification:** In the updated MLWF archive, the Wannierization is performed over a **larger energy window**, but the downfolded subspace is still restricted to the three V $t_{2g}$ orbitals.  \n",
    "   > This means the **dimension of the MLWF basis remains 3**, and you should continue to work with the \\(3\\times3\\times3\\times3\\) block corresponding to the V $t_{2g}$ orbitals.\n",
    "2. Extract the static Hubbard–Kanamori parameters $(U, U', J)$ from the output.\n",
    "3. Compare these values with those from the smaller-window calculation.  \n",
    "4. Discuss:\n",
    "   - Do you observe the expected **increase** in the bare interactions?\n",
    "   - What about the **frequency dependence**? Try to plot thier frequency dependences on the same plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 **Comment:** For MLWFs constructed from a **larger energy window**, the screened interaction $U(i\\Omega_n)$ may show an **upturn near $\\Omega_n=0$**.  \n",
    "> This occurs because the $t_{2g}$ Wannier subspace no longer exactly spans only the three bands crossing the Fermi level, leaving a residual low-energy screening channel that makes the frequency dependence more sensitive around $\\omega=0$."
