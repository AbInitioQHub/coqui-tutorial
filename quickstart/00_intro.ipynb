    "\n",
    "CoQu√≠ is a C++/MPI scientific package for **ab initio many-body electronic structure** calculations **beyond** density functional theory (**DFT**). On top of the C++ implementations, CoQu√≠ provides thin **Python wrappers** that enable direct exchange of input and output data, making it straightforward to couple with external packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "> üí° There is another way for users to interact with CoQu√≠ by writing input files in the toml format. [Examples](https://github.com/AbInitioQHub/coqui/tree/main/examples) in this mode are available. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the interest of time, in this *condensed* tutorial series we will not attempt to cover all features of CoQu√≠ or discuss APIs and input parameters in detail. Instead, the focus will be on the **concept of CoQu√≠‚Äôs code structure**, illustrating its capabilities and simplicity. More comprehensive [examples](https://github.com/AbInitioQHub/coqui/tree/main/examples) are available in [CoQu√≠ official Github organization](https://github.com/AbInitioQHub). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the current introduction notebook will: \n",
    "- Ensure you can run CoQu√≠ in the provided environment via the Python interface\n",
    "- Introduce the basic execution workflow (MPI + Python)\n",
    "- Outline the general workflow of many-body simulations in CoQu√≠\n",
    "- Outline how this tutorial series is structured"

    "### üîπ MPI Environment in CoQu√≠\n",
    "The CoQu√≠ C++ library requires that an MPI environment be initialized **before** any CoQui routine is called. \n",
    "When using CoQu√≠ from Python, this MPI environemnt must already be active ‚Äî for example, via `mpi4py` or another MPI-aware Python framework - before invoking any CoQui routines. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the MPI environment is initialized, CoQu√≠ routines become aware of it through a `coqui.MpiHandler` object. This class encapsulates information about the initialized MPI context and **must be passed, direclty or indirectly, to any CoQui routine** to ensure that MPI communication is handled consistently across the entire simulation workflow, from Hamiltonian generation to many-body simulations, to post-processing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A minimum example: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "from mpi4py import MPI    # The MPI environment is initialized here\n",
    "import coqui\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1) Create a CoQu√≠'s MPI handler\n",
    "coqui_mpi = coqui.MpiHandler()\n",

    "# 2) (Optional) Set global logging verbosity for CoQui\n",

    "if coqui_mpi.root():\n",
    "    print(coqui_mpi)\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### ‚ùì**What happens?**\n",
    "1. **MPI environment is initialized first**:  \n",
    "   `mpi4py` sets up the global MPI context before CoQu√≠ functions are called.\n",
    "3. **Create `coqui.MpiHandler` once and reused it**\n",
    "   - Captures the current MPI environment and provides access to:\n",
    "     - Global communicator (all ranks)\n",
    "     - Intranode communicator (within a single node)\n",
    "     - Internode communicator (across nodes)\n",
    "   - Must be constructed **first** and then passed to all CoQu√≠ routines that involve MPI parallelization, directly or indirectly. \n",

    "   - From `coqui.Mf`, **construct the Coulomb Hamiltonian**, which defines an interacting many-electron problem for the many-body solver.\n",
    "   - Optionally, generate **maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWFs)** for **embedding or post-processing**.\n",
    "2. **Simulation**\n",
    "   - Use the **Coulomb Hamiltonian as input** to the desired electronic structure solver, such as GW.\n",
    "   - Another feature in this simulation phase is downfolding (e.g., cRPA), which produces effective screened interactions in MLWFs for low-energy modeling.\n",
    "3. **Post-Processing**\n",

    "2. **[Prepare CoQu√≠ inputs from DFT outputs](01_dft_to_coqui_converter.ipynb)**: Converting Quantum ESPRESSO results into CoQu√≠-readable inputs and generating MLWFs via CoQu√≠'s Wannier90 interface. \n",
    "3. **[GW electronic structure](02_gw_electronic_structure.ipynb)**: Constructing the Coulomb Hamiltonian and running GW simulations, plus spectral-function post-processing.\n",
    "4. **[cRPA screened interactions](03_crpa_screened_interactions.ipynb)**: Using the same Coulomb Hamiltonian for downfolding, generating effective screened interactions in MLWFs. \n",
