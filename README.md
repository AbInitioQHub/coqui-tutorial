# CoQuo√≠ Tutorial
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks designed to help you learn and use CoQu√≠. The tutorials are organized into two tracks depending on your needs:

## üöÄ Quickstart
Short, self-contained notebooks that let you get hands-on with CoQu√≠ right away. These examples are ideal for new users who want to:
- Run simple calculations (e.g. GW on silicon)
- Explore basic workflows without needing all the theoretical details

## üî¨ Advanced
A growing collection of in-depth tutorials that explain the theory, context, and detailed workflows behind CoQu√≠. These notebooks emphasize:
- More detailed discussion of the Python API and code structure
- Use of advanced parameters and options to control calculations
- Convergence tests and best practices for many-body simulations
- The theory underlying the implementation of methods

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The Advanced tutorials are still under active development and are **not ready for users to run or check yet**.
